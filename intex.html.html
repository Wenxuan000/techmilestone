        <h1>development of computers and logical devices</h1>

        <h3>The computer was born not for entertainment or email but out of 
            a need to solve a serious number-crunching crisis. By 1880, the 
            U.S. population had grown so large that it took more than seven 
            years to tabulate the U.S. Census results. The government sought 
            a faster way to get the job done, giving rise to punch-card based 
            computers that took up entire rooms.</h3>

                           <p>Developed by John Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly, 
                                the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, or ENIAC, 
                                was built at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946. 
                                Described by the university as the “first general-purpose 
                                electronic computer,” ENIAC’s “operational characteristics” 
                                included memory and arithmetic.</p>

                        <p>IBM launched its personal computer in August 1981. 
                           While IBM’s PC was not the first — others had been 
                           available since the 1970s — its version became incredibly 
                           popular and for many it set the standards of what a PC 
                           should be. Costing $1,565, the IBM 5150 had 40K of read-only 
                           memory and 16K of user memory. Other features included a 
                           built-in speaker and the the ability to run self-diagnostic 
                           checks. It also made use of Microsoft’s MS-DOS 1.0, a 16-bit 
                           operating system.</p>

                    <p>With typical flamboyance, a bow-tie wearing
                       Steve Jobs launched the first Macintosh in 
                       January 1984. With Vangelis’ “Chariots of Fire” 
                       playing in the background, the Apple co-founder 
                       showcased a number of the Macintosh’s capabilities, 
                       from its ability to “talk” to a drawing application
                       that was able to produce sophisticated images.
                       Jobs had grand ambitions for the product. 
                       “Macintosh is targeted at two primary markets.
                        The first is the 25 million ‘knowledge workers’ 
                        who sit behind desks, and particularly those in 
                        medium and small-sized businesses. And the second 
                        market is the college worker, we think that’s the
                         knowledge worker of tomorrow and there are over 11
                          million college students in America alone.”</p>

                        as an operating system with a graphical interface. 
                        Today, the latest versions of Windows are used by

                    <p>Launched within weeks of each other in 1994, 
                    the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation consoles 
                    blazed a trail in the video gaming industry. 
                    While the PlayStation has outlasted the Saturn 
                    through multiple iterations, including today’s 
                    PlayStation 4, both consoles had a significant 
                    impact and influence on home entertainment.
                    Unlike the Super Nintendo, Sega Mega Drive and 
                    other similar consoles, games for the Saturn and 
                    PlayStation came on CDs rather than cartridges. 
                    The consoles had enough power inside to showcase 
                    games including the visually stunning “Nights into 
                    Dreams” on the Saturn and “Final Fantasy VII,” 
                    an in-depth role-playing game on the PlayStation.<p>

                        broadband internet across the developed world. 
                        Dial-up connections have become a relic of the 
                        past with users now accustomed to high-speed 
                        downloads, super-fast browsing, high-resolution 
                        streaming and a great deal more. In the U.K., 
                        for example, there were 25.3 million fixed broadband 
                        connections at the end of 2016, according to 
                        communications regulator Ofcom..</p>

                        being played on a computer in someone’s bedroom can be 
                        beamed to and displayed on a 72-inch TV in their living 
                        room via a high speed, wireless connection. This merging
